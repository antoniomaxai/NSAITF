# National Security AI Threat Framework Taxonomy - (NSAITF)

You can find the full NSAITF description in my Substack: [Algorithmic Frontiers | The IC AI Multiplier: Automating Superiority](https://antoniomax.substack.com/p/the-ic-ai-multiplier-automating-superiority)

Descriptions for the National Security AI Threat Framework categories and subcategories are available below. Categories are grouped using the following suggestion: Operation Scope, Deployment Specs, Impact Variables, and Imposed Mitigation. As the very categories and subcategories of the NSAITF, groups are not static and may be adapted and extended for custom use cases as its users see fit.

As it is, the NSAITF uses a Likert scoring scale ranging from 1 to 5, with no cumulative points. Which means that for each main scored category, in the case of multiple selections, the highest weight should be used for scoring. For the case of weighted average scoring, categories should reflect implementation realities, but the suggested default scoring may still be useful.

The NSAITF intentionally omits explicit ethics and morals dimensions, as it assumes that all attacks are inherently unethical and immoral, with variations only in their severity and impact.

Notably, the NSAITF attempts to measure both objectives and outcomes. Objectives represent the intentional rationale behind operations, while outcomes encompass the results, which may or may not align with the original objectives. Outcomes can be favorable or unfavorable and often include side effects in addition to the intended objectives. This distinction is crucial for analysts and researchers, as using the NSAITF to measure one does not necessarily cover the other. Double assessments including these two dimensions of operations may offer insights that better consolidate a realistic perspective on the relationship between outcomes and intentions.

Finally, given the complexity and politically charged nature of attributing intelligence activities, the NSAITF aims to facilitate the reverse engineering of campaigns and operations by providing a structured instrument for analysis that can be used for such ends. Future iterations and revisions of the NSAITF should strive to further enhance this capability.

## A - Operation Scope - Table 1 - Threat Actor
The Threat Actor category does not require scoring. The available options should cover most scenarios for attributing threats of offensive operations.
